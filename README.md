# flight-reservation-simulator
Simulates a flight reservation system. The program generates flights of random departure and arrival times, throughout different hours of the day, pre-booked passengers/seats, and between hardcoded cities: New York City (LGA), Albany (ALB), Buffalo (BUF), and Syracuse (SYR). Passengers can keep booking seats (300.00 per seat, 50 dollars for extra seat) until the flight is full, and checkout to pay when they are done. 

This flight reservation system demonstrates my proficiency in fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Java: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Future improvements include retrieving live data for flights (cities, arrival/departure times, available seats) from a database through REST API.
